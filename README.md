# matchingcardgame
This game takes a bunch of cards and shuffles them face down.

You get to flip them over to find a matching set until they all get matched up.

If you turn a mismatching card over, the card will turn itself face down.

If you find a correct matching card, the card will stay face up alongside the initial card that was being matched.
